# Optimized-existing-ML-model
# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with TensorFlow and Keras

This project demonstrates a simple image classification task using the CIFAR-10 dataset and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with TensorFlow and Keras.

## About the Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for image classification tasks in machine learning.

## Dependencies

To run this code, you'll need:

- Python
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Keras

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install tensorflow numpy keras

## How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd your-repository
Run the code:

Optimized and fine tuning using existing ML models.py

## Model Architecture
This code uses a simple CNN model with three convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and fully connected layers. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

## Training and Evaluation
The model is trained for 10 epochs on the CIFAR-10 training dataset. After training, it is evaluated on the test set, and the test accuracy is displayed.

## Results
The test accuracy achieved by this model is approximately 68.59%.
You can experiment with hyperparameters, data augmentation, and model architecture to improve the accuracy further.
